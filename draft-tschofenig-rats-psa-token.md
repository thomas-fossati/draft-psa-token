--- abstract

The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware and firmware
security specifications, as well as open-source reference implementations, to
help device makers and chip manufacturers build best-practice security into
products. Devices that are PSA compliant are able to produce attestation tokens
as described in this memo, which are the basis for a number of different
protocols, including secure provisioning and network access control.  This
document specifies the PSA attestation token structure and semantics.

The PSA attestation token is a profiled Entity Attestation Token (EAT).

This specification describes what claims are used in an attestation token
generated by PSA compliant systems, how these claims get serialized to the
wire, and how they are cryptographically protected.

# Introduction

Trusted execution environments are now present in many devices, which provide a
safe environment to place security sensitive code such as cryptography, secure
boot, secure storage, and other essential security functions. These security
functions are typically exposed through a narrow and well-defined interface,
and can be used by operating system libraries and applications.  Various APIs
have been developed by Arm as part of the Platform Security Architecture
{{PSA}} framework.  This document focuses on the output provided by PSA's
Initial Attestation API. Since the tokens are also consumed by services outside
the device, there is an actual need to ensure interoperability.
Interoperability needs are addressed here by describing the exact syntax and
semantics of the attestation claims, and defining the way these claims are
encoded and cryptographically protected.

Further details on concepts expressed below can be found in the PSA Security
Model documentation {{PSA-SM}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

## Glossary

RoT
: Root of Trust, the minimal set of software, hardware and data that has to be
implicitly trusted in the platform - there is no software or hardware at a
deeper level that can verify that the Root of Trust is authentic and
unmodified.  An example of RoT is an initial bootloader in ROM, which contains
cryptographic functions and credentials, running on a specific hardware
platform.

SPE
: Secure Processing Environment, a platform's processing environment for
software that provides confidentiality and integrity for its runtime state,
from software and hardware, outside of the SPE. Contains trusted code and
trusted hardware.  (Equivalent to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or
"secure world".)

NSPE
: Non Secure Processing Environment, the security domain outside of the SPE,
the Application domain, typically containing the application firmware,
operating systems, and general hardware.  (Equivalent to Rich Execution
Environment (REE), or "normal world".)

# PSA Claims
{: #sec-psa-claims }

This section describes the claims to be used in a PSA attestation token.

CDDL {{!RFC8610}} along with text descriptions is used to define each claim
independent of encoding.  The following CDDL type(s) are reused by different
claims:

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-common-types.cddl}
~~~

## Caller Claims

### Nonce
{: #sec-nonce-claim}

The Nonce claim is a challenge from the caller.

The EAT {{!I-D.ietf-rats-eat}} `nonce` (claim key 10) is used.  The following
constraints apply to the `nonce-type`:

* The length MUST be either 32, 48, or 64 bytes.
* Only a single nonce value is conveyed. Per {{!I-D.ietf-rats-eat}} the array notation is not used for encoding the nonce value.


This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-nonce.cddl}
~~~

### Client ID

The Client ID claim represents the security domain of the caller.

In PSA, a security domain is represented by a signed
integer whereby negative values represent callers from the NSPE and where
positive IDs represent callers from the SPE. The value 0 is not permitted.

For an example definition of client IDs, see the PSA Firmware Framework {{PSA-FF}}.

It is essential that this claim is checked in the verification process to
ensure that a security domain, i.e., an attestation endpoint, cannot spoof a
report from another security domain.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

Note that the CDDL label used to be called arm_psa_partition_id.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-client-id.cddl}
~~~

## Target Identification Claims

### Instance ID
{: #sec-instance-id-claim}

The Instance ID claim represents the unique identifier of the Initial
Attestation Key (IAK).  The full definition is in {{PSA-SM}}.

The EAT `ueid` (claim key 11) of type RAND is used.  The following constraints
apply to the `ueid-type`:

* The length MUST be 33 bytes.
* The first byte MUST be 0x01 (RAND) followed by the 32-bytes key hash.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-instance-id.cddl}
~~~

### Implementation ID

The Implementation ID claim uniquely identifies the underlying immutable PSA
RoT. A verification service can use this claim to locate the details of the
verification process. Such details include the implementation's origin and
associated certification state. The full definition is in {{PSA-SM}}.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-implementation-id.cddl}
~~~

### Certification Reference

The Certification Reference claim is used to link the class of chip and PSA RoT
of the attesting device to an associated entry in the PSA Certification
database. It MUST be represented as a thirteen-digit {{EAN-13}}.

Linking to the PSA Certification entry can still be achieved if this claim is
not present in the token by making an association at a Verifier between the
reference value and other token claim values - for example, the Implementation
ID.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-certification-reference.cddl}
~~~

## Target State Claims

### Security Lifecycle
{: #sec-security-lifecycle }

The Security Lifecycle claim represents the current lifecycle state of the PSA
RoT. The state is represented by an integer that is divided to convey a major
state and a minor state. A major state is mandatory and defined by {{PSA-SM}}.
A minor state is optional and 'IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED'. The PSA security
lifecycle state and implementation state are encoded as follows:

* version\[15:8\] - PSA security lifecycle state, and
* version\[7:0\] - IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED state.

The PSA lifecycle states are illustrated in {{fig-lifecycle-states}}. For PSA,
a remote verifier can only trust reports from the PSA RoT when it is in SECURED
or NON_PSA_ROT_DEBUG major states.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

<t>
  <figure anchor="fig-lifecycle-states" title="PSA Lifecycle States">
    <artset>
      <artwork type="ascii-art" src="art/psa-lifecycle.ascii-art" />
      <artwork type="svg" src="art/psa-lifecycle.svg" />
    </artset>
  </figure>
</t>

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-security-lifecycle.cddl}
~~~

### Boot Seed

The Boot Seed claim represents a random value created at system boot time that
will allow differentiation of reports from different boot sessions.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-boot-seed.cddl}
~~~

## Software Inventory Claims

### Software Components
{: #sec-sw-components }

The Software Components claim is a list of software components that includes
all the software loaded by the PSA RoT. This claim SHALL be included in
attestation tokens produced by an implementation conformant with {{PSA-SM}}.
If the Software Components claim is present, then the No Software Measurement
claim ({{sec-no-sw-measurements}}) MUST NOT be present.

Each entry in the Software Components list describes one software component
using the attributes described in the following subsections.  Unless explicitly
stated, the presence of an attribute is OPTIONAL.

Note that, as described in {{?I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}}, a relying party
will typically see the result of the verification process from the Verifier in
form of an attestation result, rather than the "naked" PSA token from the
attesting endpoint.  Therefore, a relying party is not expected to understand
the Software Components claim.  Instead, it is for the Verifier to check this
claim against the available endorsements and provide an answer in form of an
"high level" attestation result, which may or may not include the original
Software Components claim.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-software-components.cddl}
~~~

#### Measurement Type

The Measurement Type attribute (key=1) is short string representing the role of
this software component.

The following measurement types MAY be used:

* "BL": a Boot Loader
* "PRoT": a component of the PSA Root of Trust
* "ARoT": a component of the Application Root of Trust
* "App": a component of the NSPE application
* "TS": a component of a Trusted Subsystem

#### Measurement Value

The Measurement Value attribute (key=2) represents a hash of the invariant
software component in memory at startup time. The value MUST be a cryptographic
hash of 256 bits or stronger.

This attribute MUST be present in a PSA software component.

#### Version

The Version attribute (key=4) is the issued software version in the form of a
text string. The value of this attribute will correspond to the entry in the
original signed manifest of the component.

#### Signer ID

The Signer ID attribute (key=5) is the hash of a signing authority public key
for the software component. The value of this attribute will correspond to the
entry in the original manifest for the component. This can be used by a
verifier to ensure the components were signed by an expected trusted source.

This attribute MUST be present in a PSA software component to be compliant with
{{PSA-SM}}.

#### Measurement Description

The Measurement Description attribute (key=6) is the description of the way in
which the measurement value of the software component is computed. The value
will be a text string containing an abbreviated description (or name) of the
measurement method which can be used to lookup the details of the method in a
profile document. This attribute will normally be excluded, unless there was an
exception to the default measurement described in the profile for a specific
component.

### No Software Measurements
{: #sec-no-sw-measurements }

In the event that the implementation does not contain any software measurements
then the Software Components claim {{sec-sw-components}} can be omitted but
instead the token MUST include this claim to indicate this is a deliberate
state. The value SHOULD be 1.  This claim is intended for devices that are not
compliant with {{PSA-SM}}.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-no-sw-measurements.cddl}
~~~

## Verification Claims

### Verification Service Indicator

The Verification Service Indicator claim is a hint used by a relying party to
locate a validation service for the token. The value is a text string that can
be used to locate the service or a URL specifying the address of the service. A
verifier may choose to ignore this claim in favor of other information.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-verification-service-indicator.cddl}
~~~

### Profile Definition
{: #sec-profile-definition-claim}

The Profile Definition claim encodes the unique identifier that corresponds to
the EAT profile described by this document.  This allows a receiver to assign
the intended semantics to the rest of the claims found in the token.

The EAT `profile` (claim key 18) is used.  The following constraints
apply to its type:

* The URI encoding MUST be used.
* The value MUST be `http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0`.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

See {{sec-backwards-compat}}, for considerations about backwards compatibility
with previous versions of the PSA attestation token format.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-profile.cddl}
~~~

# Backwards Compatibility Considerations
{: #sec-backwards-compat}

Previous versions of this specification used different claim key values for the following
claims:

* Nonce (claim key -75008);
* Instance ID (claim key -75009);
* Profile Description (claim key -75000 and value `PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1`).

These claim keys have been retired and their use is deprecated.

Unless compatibility with existing infrastructure is a concern, emitters (e.g.,
devices that implement the PSA Attestation API) SHOULD produce tokens with
their standard equivalent instead, as described in {{sec-nonce-claim}},
{{sec-instance-id-claim}} and {{sec-profile-definition-claim}} respectively.

To simplify the transition to the token format described in this
document it is RECOMMENDED that receivers (e.g., PSA Attestation Verifiers)
accept tokens encoded according to the old profile (`PROFILE_IOT_1`) as well as
to the new profile (`http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0`), at least for the time needed to
their clients to upgrade.

# Token Encoding and Signing

The PSA attestation token is encoded in CBOR {{!RFC7049}} format.  Only
definite-length string, arrays, and maps are allowed.

Cryptographic protection is obtained by wrapping the `psa-token` map in a COSE
Web Token (CWT) {{!RFC8392}}.  For asymmetric key algorithms, the signature
structure MUST be COSE_Sign1.  For symmetric key algorithms, the signature
structure MUST be COSE_Mac0.

The CWT CBOR tag (61) is not used.  An application that needs to exchange PSA
attestation tokens can use the media type defined in {{sec-iana-media-types}}
or the CoAP Content-Format defined in {{sec-iana-coap-content-format}}.

# Freshness Model

The PSA Token supports the freshness models for attestation Evidence based on
nonces and epoch handles (Section 10.2 and 10.3 of
{{?I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}}) using the `nonce` claim to convey the nonce or
epoch handle supplied by the Verifier.  No further assumption on the specific
remote attestation protocol is made.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

This specification re-uses the CWT and the EAT specification. Hence, the
security and privacy considerations of those specifications apply here as well.

Since CWTs offer different ways to protect the token, this specification
profiles those options and allows signatures based on use of public key
cryptography as well as MAC authentication. The token MUST be signed following
the structure of the COSE specification {{!RFC8152}}.  The COSE type MUST be
COSE_Sign1 for public key signatures or COSE_Mac0 for MAC authentication.  Note
however that use of MAC authentication is NOT RECOMMENDED due to the associated
infrastructure costs for key management and protocol complexities. It may also
restrict the ability to interoperate with third parties.

Attestation tokens contain information that may be unique to a device and
therefore they may allow to single out an individual device for tracking
purposes.  Implementations that have privacy requirements must take appropriate
measures to ensure that the token is only used to provision anonymous/pseudonym
keys.

# Verification

To verify the token, the primary need is to check correct formation and signing
as for any CWT token.  In addition though, the verifier can operate a policy
where values of some of the claims in this profile can be compared to reference
values, registered with the verifier for a given deployment, in order to
confirm that the device is endorsed by the manufacturer supply chain.  The
policy may require that the relevant claims must have a match to a registered
reference value.  All claims may be worthy of additional appraisal.  It is
likely that most deployments would include a policy with appraisal for the
following claims:

* Instance ID - the value of the Instance ID can be used (together with the kid
  in the token COSE header, if present) to assist in locating the public key
  used to verify the token signature.
* Implementation ID - the value of the Implementation ID can be used to
  identify the verification requirements of the deployment.
* Software Component, Measurement Value - this value can uniquely identify a
  firmware release from the supply chain. In some cases, a verifier may
  maintain a record for a series of firmware releases, being patches to an
  original baseline release. A verification policy may then allow this value to
  match any point on that release sequence or expect some minimum level of
  maturity related to the sequence.
* Software Component, Signer ID - where present in a deployment, this could
  allow a verifier to operate a more general policy than that for Measurement
  Value as above, by allowing a token to contain any firmware entries signed by
  a known Signer ID, without checking for a uniquely registered version.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is provided by the Trusted Firmware project {{TF-M}}.

# Example

The following example shows a PSA attestation token for an hypothetical system
comprising two measured software components (a boot loader and a trusted RTOS).
The attesting device is in a lifecycle state {{sec-security-lifecycle}} of
SECURED.  The attestation has been requested from a client residing in the
SPE:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/psa-token.diag}
~~~

The JWK representation of the IAK used for creating the COSE Sign1 signature
over the PSA token is:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/iak.jwk}
~~~

The resulting COSE object is:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/cose.diag}
