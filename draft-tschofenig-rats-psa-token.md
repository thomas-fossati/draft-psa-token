--- abstract

The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware and firmware
security specifications, as well as open-source reference implementations, to
help device makers and chip manufacturers build best-practice security into
products. Devices that are PSA compliant are able to produce attestation tokens
as described in this memo, which are the basis for a number of different
protocols, including secure provisioning and network access control.  This
document specifies the PSA attestation token structure and semantics.

The PSA attestation token is a profiled Entity Attestation Token (EAT).

This specification describes what claims are used in an attestation token
generated by PSA compliant systems, how these claims get serialized to the
wire, and how they are cryptographically protected.

# Introduction

Trusted execution environments are now present in many devices, which provide a
safe environment to place security sensitive code such as cryptography, secure
boot, secure storage, and other essential security functions. These security
functions are typically exposed through a narrow and well-defined interface,
and can be used by operating system libraries and applications.  Various APIs
have been developed by Arm as part of the Platform Security Architecture
{{PSA}} framework.  This document focuses on the output provided by PSA's
Initial Attestation API. Since the tokens are also consumed by services outside
the device, there is an actual need to ensure interoperability.
Interoperability needs are addressed here by describing the exact syntax and
semantics of the attestation claims, and defining the way these claims are
encoded and cryptographically protected.

Further details on concepts expressed below can be found in the PSA Security
Model documentation {{PSA-SM}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

## Glossary

{: vspace="0"}
RoT:
: Root of Trust, the minimal set of software, hardware and data that has to be
implicitly trusted in the platform - there is no software or hardware at a
deeper level that can verify that the Root of Trust is authentic and
unmodified.  An example of RoT is an initial bootloader in ROM, which contains
cryptographic functions and credentials, running on a specific hardware
platform.

SPE:
: Secure Processing Environment, a platform's processing environment for
software that provides confidentiality and integrity for its runtime state,
from software and hardware, outside of the SPE. Contains trusted code and
trusted hardware.  (Equivalent to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or
"secure world".)

NSPE:
: Non Secure Processing Environment, the security domain outside of the SPE,
the Application domain, typically containing the application firmware,
operating systems, and general hardware.  (Equivalent to Rich Execution
Environment (REE), or "normal world".)

# PSA Attester Model

{{fig-psa-attester}} outlines the structure of the PSA Attester according to
the conceptual model described in {{Section 3.1 of RFC9334}}.

~~~ aasvg
{::include art/psa-attester.ascii-art}
~~~
{: #fig-psa-attester title="PSA Attester" }

The PSA Attester is a relatively straightforward embodiment of the RATS
Attester with exactly one Attesting Environment and one Target Environment.

The Attesting Environment is responsible for collecting the information to be
represented in PSA claims and to assemble them into Evidence. It is made of two
cooperating components:

* The Main Bootloader (executing at boot-time) measures the loaded software
  components, collects the relevant PSA RoT parameters, and stores the recorded
  information in secure memory (Main Boot State) from where the Initial
  Attestation Service will, when asked for a platform attestation report,
  retrieve them.

* The Initial Attestation Service (executing at run-time in SPE) answers
  requests coming from NSPE via the PSA attestation API {{PSA-API}}, collects
  and formats the claims from Main Boot State, and uses the Initial Attestation
  Key (IAK) to sign the attestation report.

The Target Environment can be broken down into four macro "objects", some of
which may or may not be present depending on the device architecture:

* (A subset of) the PSA RoT parameters, including Instance and Implementation
  IDs.

* The updateable PSA RoT, including the Secure Partition Manager and all PSA
  RoT services.

* The (optional) Application RoT, that is any application-defined security
  service, possibly making use of the PSA RoT services.

* The loader of the application software running in NSPE.

A reference implementation of the PSA Attester is provided by {{TF-M}}.

# PSA Claims
{: #sec-psa-claims }

This section describes the claims to be used in a PSA attestation token.

CDDL {{!RFC8610}} along with text descriptions is used to define each claim
independent of encoding.  The following CDDL type(s) are reused by different
claims:

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-common-types.cddl}
~~~

## Caller Claims

### Nonce
{: #sec-nonce-claim}

The Nonce claim is used to carry the challenge provided by the caller to demonstrate freshness of the generated token.

The EAT {{!I-D.ietf-rats-eat}} `nonce` (claim key 10) is used.  The following
constraints apply to the `nonce-type`:

* The length MUST be either 32, 48, or 64 bytes.
* Only a single nonce value is conveyed. Per {{!I-D.ietf-rats-eat}} the array notation is not used for encoding the nonce value.


This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-nonce.cddl}
~~~

### Client ID
{: #sec-client-id}

The Client ID claim represents the security domain of the caller.

In PSA, a security domain is represented by a signed
integer whereby negative values represent callers from the NSPE and where
positive IDs represent callers from the SPE. The value 0 is not permitted.

For an example definition of client IDs, see the PSA Firmware FrameworkÂ {{PSA-FF}}.

It is essential that this claim is checked in the verification process to
ensure that a security domain, i.e., an attestation endpoint, cannot spoof a
report from another security domain.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-client-id.cddl}
~~~

## Target Identification Claims

###Â Instance ID
{: #sec-instance-id-claim}

The Instance ID claim represents the unique identifier of the Initial
Attestation Key (IAK).  The full definition is in {{PSA-SM}}.

The EAT `ueid` (claim key 256) of type RAND is used.  The following constraints
apply to the `ueid-type`:

* The length MUST be 33 bytes.
* The first byte MUST be 0x01 (RAND) followed by the 32-bytes key hash.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-instance-id.cddl}
~~~

### Implementation ID
{: #sec-implementation-id}

The Implementation ID claim uniquely identifies the implementation of the
immutable PSA RoT. A verification service uses this claim to locate the
details of the PSA RoT implementation from an Endorser or manufacturer.
Such details are used by a verification service to determine the security properties
or certification status of the PSA RoT implementation.

The value and format of the ID is decided by
the manufacturer or a particular certification scheme. For example, the ID
could take the form of a product serial number,
database ID, or other appropriate identifier.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

Note that this identifies the PSA RoT implementation, not a particular instance.
To uniquely identify an instance, see the Instance ID claim {{sec-instance-id-claim}}.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-implementation-id.cddl}
~~~

### Certification Reference
{: #sec-certification-reference}

The Certification Reference claim is used to link the class of chip and PSA RoT
of the attesting device to an associated entry in the PSA Certification
database. It MUST be represented as a string made of nineteen numeric
characters: a thirteen-digit {{EAN-13}}, followed by a dash "-", followed by
the five-digit versioning information described in {{PSA-Cert-Guide}}.

Linking to the PSA Certification entry can still be achieved if this claim is
not present in the token by making an association at a Verifier between the
reference value and other token claim values - for example, the Implementation
ID.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-certification-reference.cddl}
~~~

## Target State Claims

### Security Lifecycle
{: #sec-security-lifecycle }

The Security Lifecycle claim represents the current lifecycle state of the PSA
RoT. The state is represented by an integer that is divided to convey a major
state and a minor state. A major state is mandatory and defined by {{PSA-SM}}.
A minor state is optional and 'IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED'. The PSA security
lifecycle state and implementation state are encoded as follows:

* version\[15:8\] - PSA security lifecycle state, and
* version\[7:0\] - IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED state.

The PSA lifecycle states are illustrated in {{fig-lifecycle-states}}. For PSA,
a Verifier can only trust reports from the PSA RoT when it is in SECURED or
NON_PSA_ROT_DEBUG major states.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

~~~ aasvg
{::include art/psa-lifecycle.ascii-art}
~~~
{: #fig-lifecycle-states title="PSA Lifecycle States" }

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-security-lifecycle.cddl}
~~~

### Boot Seed
{: #sec-boot-seed }

The Boot Seed claim represents a value created at system boot time that
will allow differentiation of reports from different boot sessions.

This claim MAY be present in a PSA attestation token.

If present, it MUST be between 8 and 32 bytes.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-boot-seed.cddl}
~~~

## Software Inventory Claims

### Software Components
{: #sec-sw-components }

The Software Components claim is a list of software components that includes
all the software (both code and configuration) loaded by the PSA RoT.  This
claim MUST be included in attestation tokens produced by an implementation
conformant with {{PSA-SM}}.

Each entry in the Software Components list describes one software component
using the attributes described in the following subsections.  Unless explicitly
stated, the presence of an attribute is OPTIONAL.

Note that, as described in {{RFC9334}}, a relying party will typically see the
result of the verification process from the Verifier in form of an attestation
result, rather than the PSA token from the attesting endpoint.
Therefore, a relying party is not expected to understand the Software
Components claim.  Instead, it is for the Verifier to check this claim against
the available endorsements and provide an answer in form of an "high level"
attestation result, which may or may not include the original Software
Components claim.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-software-components.cddl}
~~~

#### Measurement Type

The Measurement Type attribute (key=1) is short string representing the role of
this software component.

The following measurement types MAY be used for code measurements:

* "BL": a Boot Loader
* "PRoT": a component of the PSA Root of Trust
* "ARoT": a component of the Application Root of Trust
* "App": a component of the NSPE application
* "TS": a component of a Trusted Subsystem

The same labels with a "-config" postfix (e.g., "PRoT-config") MAY be used for
configuration measurements.

####Â Measurement Value

The Measurement Value attribute (key=2) represents a hash of the invariant
software component in memory at startup time. The value MUST be a cryptographic
hash of 256 bits or stronger.

This attribute MUST be present in a PSA software component.

#### Version

The Version attribute (key=4) is the issued software version in the form of a
text string. The value of this attribute will correspond to the entry in the
original signed manifest of the component.

#### Signer ID

The Signer ID attribute (key=5) is the hash of a signing authority public key
for the software component. The value of this attribute will correspond to the
entry in the original manifest for the component. This can be used by a
Verifier to ensure the components were signed by an expected trusted source.

This attribute MUST be present in a PSA software component to be compliant with
{{PSA-SM}}.

#### Measurement Description

The Measurement Description attribute (key=6) contains a string identifying the
hash algorithm used to compute the corresponding Measurement Value.  The string
SHOULD be encoded according to {{IANA-HashFunctionTextualNames}}.

## Verification Claims

### Verification Service Indicator
{: #sec-verification-service-indicator}

The Verification Service Indicator claim is a hint used by a relying party to
locate a verification service for the token. The value is a text string that
can be used to locate the service (typically, a URL specifying the address of
the verification service API). A Relying Party may choose to ignore this claim
in favor of other information.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-verification-service-indicator.cddl}
~~~

### Profile Definition
{: #sec-profile-definition-claim}

The Profile Definition claim encodes the unique identifier that corresponds to
the EAT profile described by this document.  This allows a receiver to assign
the intended semantics to the rest of the claims found in the token.

The EAT `profile` (claim key 265) is used.  The following constraints
apply to its type:

* The URI encoding MUST be used.
* The value MUST be `http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0`.

This claim MUST be present in a PSA attestation token.

See {{sec-backwards-compat}}, for considerations about backwards compatibility
with previous versions of the PSA attestation token format.

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-profile.cddl}
~~~

# Backwards Compatibility Considerations
{: #sec-backwards-compat}

A previous version of this specification (identified by the `PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1`
profile) used claim key values from the "private use range" of the CWT Claims
registry.  These claim keys have now been retired and their use is deprecated.

{{tab-claim-map}} provides the mappings between the deprecated and new claim
keys.

| | PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1 | http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0 |
|-|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Nonce | -75008 | 10 (EAT nonce) |
| Instance ID | -75009 | 256 (EAT euid) |
| Profile Definition | -75000 | 265 (EAT eat_profile) |
| Client ID | -75001 | 2394 |
| Security Lifecycle | -75002 | 2395 |
| Implementation ID | -75003 | 2396 |
| Boot Seed | -75004 | 2397 |
| Certification Reference | -75005 | 2398 |
| Software Components | -75006 | 2399 |
| Verification Service Indicator | -75010 | 2400 |
{: #tab-claim-map title="Claim key mappings"}

The new profile introduces three further changes:

* the "Boot Seed" claim is now optional and variable length (see
  {{sec-boot-seed}}),
* the "No Software Measurements" claim has been retired,
* the "Certification Reference" syntax changed from EAN-13 to EAN-13+5 (see
  {{sec-certification-reference}}).

Unless compatibility with existing infrastructure is a concern, emitters (e.g.,
devices that implement the PSA Attestation API) SHOULD produce tokens with
the claim keys specified in this document.

To simplify the transition to the token format described in this
document it is RECOMMENDED that receivers (e.g., PSA Attestation Verifiers)
accept tokens encoded according to the old profile (`PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1`) as well as
to the new profile (`http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0`), at least for the time needed to
their clients to upgrade.

#Â Token Encoding and Signing
{: #sec-token-encoding-and-signing}

The PSA attestation token is encoded in CBOR {{!RFC8949}} format.  Only
definite-length string, arrays, and maps are allowed.

Cryptographic protection is obtained by wrapping the `psa-token` map in a COSE
Web Token (CWT) {{!RFC8392}}.  For asymmetric key algorithms, the signature
structure MUST be COSE_Sign1.  For symmetric key algorithms, the signature
structure MUST be COSE_Mac0.

Acknowledging the variety of markets, regulations and use cases in which the
PSA attestation token can be used, this specification does not impose any
strong requirement on the cryptographic algorithms that need to be supported by
Attesters and Verifiers.  It is assumed that the flexibility provided by the
COSE format is sufficient to deal with the level of cryptographic agility
needed to adapt to specific use cases.  For interoperability considerations, it
is RECOMMENDED that commonly adopted algorithms are used, such as those
discussed in {{COSE-ALGS}}).  It is expected that receivers (Verifiers and
Relying Parties) will accept a wider range of algorithms, while Attesters would
produce PSA tokens using only one such algorithm.

The CWT CBOR tag (61) is not used.  An application that needs to exchange PSA
attestation tokens can wrap the serialised COSE_Sign1 or COSE_Mac0 in the media
type defined in {{sec-iana-media-types}} or the CoAP Content-Format defined in
{{sec-iana-coap-content-format}}.

# Scalability Considerations
{: #sec-scalability}

IAKs can be either raw public keys or certified public keys.

Certified public keys require the manufacturer to run the certification
authority that issues x.509 certs for the IAKs.

This approach provides sensibly better scalability properties compared to using
raw public keys, namely:

* storage requirements on the verifier side are minimised - the same
  manufacturer's trust anchor is used for any number of devices,
* the provisioning model is simpler and more robust since there is no need to
  notify the verifier about each newly manufactured device.

The IAK's x.509 cert can be inlined in the PSA token using the `x5chain` COSE
header parameter {{COSE-X509}} at the cost of an increase in the PSA token
size.  {{Section 4.4 of TLS12-IoT}} and {{Section 15 of TLS13-IoT}} provide
guidance for profiling x.509 certs used in IoT deployments.

# Freshness Model

The PSA Token supports the freshness models for attestation Evidence based on
nonces and epoch handles ({{Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 of RFC9334}}) using
the `nonce` claim to convey the nonce or epoch handle supplied by the Verifier.
No further assumption on the specific remote attestation protocol is made.

# Collated CDDL

~~~
{::include cddl/psa-attestation.cddl}
~~~

# Implementation Status

Implementations of this specification are provided by the Trusted
Firmware-M project {{TF-M}}, the Veraison project {{Veraison}}, and the Xclaim
{{Xclaim}} library.  All three implementations are released as open-source software.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

This specification re-uses the EAT specification and therefore the CWT specification.
Hence, the security and privacy considerations of those specifications apply here as well.

Since CWTs offer different ways to protect the token, this specification
profiles those options and allows signatures using public key cryptography as
well as message authentication codes (MACs). COSE_Sign1 is used for digital
signatures and COSE_Mac0 for MACs, as defined in the COSE specification {{STD96}}.
Note, however, that the use of MAC authentication is NOT RECOMMENDED due to the associated
infrastructure costs for key management and protocol complexities.

Attestation tokens contain information that may be unique to a device and
therefore they may allow to single out an individual device for tracking
purposes.  Deployments that have privacy requirements must take appropriate
measures to ensure that the token is only used to provision anonymous/pseudonym
keys.

# Verification

To verify the token, the primary need is to check correct encoding and signing
as detailed in {{sec-token-encoding-and-signing}}.
The key used for verification is either supplied to the Verifier by an
authorized Endorser along with the corresponding Attester's Instance ID or
inlined in the token using the `x5chain` header parameter as described in
{{sec-scalability}}.
If the IAK is a raw public key, the Instance ID claim is used (together with
the kid in the COSE header, if present) to assist in locating the public key
used to verify the signature covering the CWT token.

In addition, the Verifier will typically operate a policy where values of some
of the claims in this profile can be compared to reference values, registered
with the Verifier for a given deployment, in order to confirm that the device
is endorsed by the manufacturer supply chain.  The policy may require that the
relevant claims must have a match to a registered reference value.  All claims
may be worthy of additional appraisal.  It is likely that most deployments
would include a policy with appraisal for the following claims:

* Implementation ID - the value of the Implementation ID can be used to
  identify the verification requirements of the deployment.
* Software Component, Measurement Value - this value can uniquely identify a
  firmware release from the supply chain. In some cases, a Verifier may
  maintain a record for a series of firmware releases, being patches to an
  original baseline release. A verification policy may then allow this value to
  match any point on that release sequence or expect some minimum level of
  maturity related to the sequence.
* Software Component, Signer ID - where present in a deployment, this could
  allow a Verifier to operate a more general policy than that for Measurement
  Value as above, by allowing a token to contain any firmware entries signed by
  a known Signer ID, without checking for a uniquely registered version.
* Certification Reference - if present, this value could be used as a hint to
  locate security certification information associated with the attesting
  device. An example could be a reference to a {{PSACertified}} certificate.

##Â AR4SI Trustworthiness Claims Mappings

{{RATS-AR4SI}} defines an information model that Verifiers can employ to
produce Attestation Results.
AR4SI provides a set of standardized appraisal categories and tiers that
greatly simplifies the task of writing Relying Party policies in multi-attester
environments.

The contents of {{tab-ar4si-map}} are intended as guidance for implementing a
PSA Verifier that computes its results using AR4SI.
The table describes which PSA Evidence claims (if any) are related to which
AR4SI trustworthiness claim, and therefore what the Verifier must consider when
deciding if and how to appraise a certain feature associated with the PSA
Attester.

Trustworthiness Vector claims | Related PSA claims
---|---
`configuration` | Software Components ({{sec-sw-components}})
`executables` | ditto
`file-system` | N/A
`hardware` | Implementation ID ({{sec-implementation-id}})
`instance-identity` | Instance ID ({{sec-instance-id-claim}}).  The Security Lifecycle ({{sec-security-lifecycle}}) can also impact the derived identity.
`runtime-opaque` | Indirectly derived from `executables`, `hardware`, and `instance-identity`.  The Security Lifecycle ({{sec-security-lifecycle}}) can also be relevant: for example, any debug state will expose otherwise protected memory.
`sourced-data` | N/A
`storage-opaque` | Indirectly derived from `executables`, `hardware`, and `instance-identity`.
{: #tab-ar4si-map title="AR4SI Claims mappings"}

This document does not prescribe what value must be chosen based on each
possible situation: when assigning specific Trustworthiness Claim values, an
implementation is expected to follow the algorithm described in {{Section 2.3.3
of RATS-AR4SI}}.

## Endorsements, Reference Values and Verification Key Material

{{PSA-Endorsements}} defines a protocol based on the {{RATS-CoRIM}} data model
that can be used to convey PSA Endorsements, Reference Values and verification
key material to the Verifier.

## Media Type Registration
{: #sec-iana-media-types}

To indicate that the transmitted content is a PSA Attestation Token,
applications can use the `application/eat-cwt` media type defined in
{{!I-D.ietf-rats-eat-media-type}} with the `eat_profile` parameter set to
`http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0` (or `PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1` if the token is encoded
according to the old profile, see {{sec-backwards-compat}}).

## CoAP Content-Formats Registration
{: #sec-iana-coap-content-format}

IANA is requested to register two CoAP Content-Format IDs in the "CoAP
Content-Formats" registry {{IANA-CoAP-Content-Formats}}:

* One for the `application/eat-cwt` media type with the `eat_profile` parameter
  equal to `http://arm.com/psa/2.0.0`
* Another for the `application/eat-cwt` media type with the `eat_profile`
  parameter equal to `PSA_IOT_PROFILE_1`

### Registry Contents

# Example

The following example shows a PSA attestation token for an hypothetical system
comprising two measured software components (a boot loader and a trusted RTOS).
The attesting device is in a lifecycle state {{sec-security-lifecycle}} of
SECURED.  The attestation has been requested from a client residing in the
SPE:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/psa-token.diag}
~~~

The JWK representation of the IAK used for creating the COSE Sign1 signature
over the PSA token is:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/iak.jwk}
~~~

The resulting COSE object is:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/cose.diag}
~~~

which has the following base16 encoding:

~~~
{::include cddl/example/cose.hex}
~~~
